### REGISTER NUMBER : 25005962
### Aim: To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 1. Straightforward Prompts, 2. Tabular Format Prompting 3.Preceding Question Prompting and 4. Missing Word Prompting

### Explanation - Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
1.	Straightforward Prompts:
    - •	"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
    - 	"List three advantages of electric vehicles."

 3.	Tabular Format Prompting:
     •	"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."
     •	"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."
3. Preceding Question Prompting:
    •	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
    •	"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."
4. Missing Word Prompting:
   •	"The capital of France is ____."
  •	"In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____."

ALGORITHM:
1. Straightforward Prompts

Prompt 1:
“Define photosynthesis in one sentence.”

Response:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.

Prompt 2:
“List three advantages of electric vehicles.”

Response:

Reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

Lower running and maintenance costs.

Quieter operation with better energy efficiency.

Evaluation (Method: Clarity, Completeness, Accuracy):
✅ Clear and concise answers.
✅ Factual accuracy maintained.
✅ Limited depth due to brevity.
Score: 9/10

2. Tabular Format Prompting

Prompt 1:
“Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table.”

Aspect	AC (Alternating Current)	DC (Direct Current)
Direction of flow	Changes periodically	Flows in one direction
Source	Power stations, generators	Batteries, solar cells
Transmission	Suitable for long-distance	Short-distance use
Example	Household power supply	Mobile chargers

Prompt 2:
“Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each.”

Programming Language	Paradigm	Use Case
Python	Object-Oriented	Machine Learning
Java	Object-Oriented	Android Apps
C	Procedural	System Programming
JavaScript	Event-Driven	Web Development
SQL	Declarative	Database Management

Evaluation:
✅ Clear visual comparison.
✅ Easy to interpret and structured.
✅ Best for technical and data-based topics.
Score: 10/10

3. Preceding Question Prompting

Prompt 1:
“Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.”

Response:
Climate change is a global concern because it leads to rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events. Greenhouse gases like CO₂ trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, causing a rise in global temperatures known as global warming.

Prompt 2:
“How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms.”

Response:
Vaccines introduce a harmless form of a pathogen to train the immune system. This helps the body recognize and fight the real pathogen if encountered later, providing immunity.

Evaluation:
✅ Encourages reasoning and explanation.
✅ More detailed and conceptual.
✅ Slightly longer and more complex to process.
Score: 8.5/10

4. Missing Word Prompting

Prompt 1:
“The capital of France is ____.”
Response: Paris

Prompt 2:
“In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____.”
Response: Glucose

Evaluation:
✅ Best for factual recall or testing understanding.
✅ Limited depth but precise.
Score: 8/10

5. Evaluation Method Used

Method: Qualitative Evaluation — Clarity, Completeness, and Accuracy.

Prompt Type	Clarity	Completeness	Accuracy	Average Score
Straightforward	9	8	9	8.7
Tabular Format	10	10	10	10.0
Preceding Question	9	8	8.5	8.5
Missing Word	8	7	9	8.0

### Conclusion 
Among the four prompt types, Tabular Format Prompting achieved the highest score (10/10). It provides structured, easy-to-read comparisons, making it ideal for technical or data-driven topics.
Straightforward and Preceding Question prompts are effective for conceptual clarity, while Missing Word prompting is best suited for factual or quick assessments.


Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.




# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
